//! # Introduction
//!
//! XIDs (eXtensible IDentity, */zid/*) are unique 32-byte identifier that
//! represent any entities—real or abstract—such as a person, organization, or
//! device. Generated from the SHA-256 hash of a specific public signing key
//! known as the inception key, a XID provides a stable identity throughout its
//! lifecycle, even as associated keys and permissions evolve. Leveraging
//! Gordian Envelope for XID Documents, XIDs are recursively resolvable and
//! extensible, allowing for detailed assertions about the entity, including key
//! declarations, permissions, controllers, and endpoints. The integration of
//! [provenance marks](https://provemark.com) ensures a verifiable chain of
//! document revisions, enhancing security and authenticity in decentralized
//! identity management.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! bc-xid = "0.8.0"
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See the unit tests in the source code for examples of how to use this
//! library.
